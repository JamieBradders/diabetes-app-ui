# diabetes-app-ui
React Application for Real Time Blood Chart

This app works in conjunction with a Node application [found here](https://github.com/jamie-endeavour/diabetes-app-node).

Simply clone the Node App repository and run it locally (instructions located on the Diabetes Node App repo).

Once the Node App is running the Diabetes App UI application will be able to integrate with the Node API and retrieve
various metrics surrounding my blood sugar results.

**Note:** The current data is test data, this is not a true reflection of my actual blood sugar control!
